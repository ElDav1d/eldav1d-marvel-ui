# ElDav1d Marvel UI

This is an UI library effort consisting in the abstraction of mere presentational components applied on my pet project [Playing wirth Marvel API](https://github.com/ElDav1d/playing-with-marvel-api)

## Stack is React + TypeScript + Vite + Vitest + React Testing Library + Storybook + SWC + TailwindCSS

This project is transpiled with SWC for better performance

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started
